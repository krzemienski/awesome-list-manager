# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for AwesomeListManager (ALM)

## 1. Project Overview

AwesomeListManager (ALM) is a web-based platform aimed at simplifying and enhancing the management of AwesomeLists. It is intended to serve individuals and teams involved in curating content by improving the manipulation, categorization, and sharing of lists in open-source repositories. The platform addresses the challenges faced by AwesomeList maintainers, content curators, and open-source contributors, offering an intuitive interface coupled with powerful integration capabilities. With ALM, users can streamline their list management processes, benefiting from automation, AI-driven suggestions, and seamless GitHub integration.

The motivation behind ALM's development is to enrich the user experience by providing tools that make the discovery and contribution of resources more efficient and insightful. Our key objective is to build a responsive, user-friendly platform that offers real-time insights and streamlined processes, aiding users in maintaining high-quality lists with minimal effort. Success for ALM will be measured by user adoption rates, user feedback on efficiency improvements, and the quality of integration with existing open-source workflows.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   User account management with role-based access controls.
*   Integration with GitHub for importing and managing repositories.
*   AI-powered tools for content categorization and auto-suggestions.
*   Insightful analytics dashboards displaying list health and activity metrics.
*   Notification mechanisms for updates regarding new pull requests and suggested content.
*   Export functionality for lists in Markdown, CSV, and JSON formats.
*   Responsive design accessible on various devices.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Integration with repository hosting platforms other than GitHub in the initial phase.
*   Advanced monetization strategies, premium features, or subscriptions.
*   In-depth machine learning pipeline development beyond initial auto-categorization.
*   Initial deployment outside of North America and Europe.

## 3. User Flow

Upon accessing the AwesomeListManager platform, users authenticate using Supabase Auth, after which they can select their role (Admin, Maintainer, or Read-Only User). The user's selected role determines their level of access. From the main dashboard, users can import repositories linked to their GitHub account. This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of their lists, offers syncing capabilities between local and remote repositories, and shows relevant notifications.

After successfully importing their repositories, users can leverage the Categorization Workbench to auto-categorize list entries using AI tools. They receive instant suggestions for improvements which they can review. The Analytics Dashboard then provides insights into list activity, showing popularity metrics and other vital information. Users can set their notification preferences for alerts, like updates on new pull requests, which the platform will deliver via the chosen method (Slack, email, SMS). Finally, users can export list data in their preferred format, with the option to provide feedback to improve future AI-generated suggestions.

## 4. Core Features (Bullet Points)

*   Role-based access control through Supabase Auth.
*   GitHub integration for importing, exporting, and synchronizing repositories.
*   AI-powered link categorization and suggestion tool using OpenAI GPT-4o.
*   Detailed analytics dashboard for tracking list health and popularity.
*   Automated notification system with integrations for Slack, email, and SMS.
*   Multi-format export options (Markdown, CSV, and JSON).
*   Responsive and minimalistic UI design ensuring accessibility across devices.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript.
*   **Styling Libraries**: Tailwind CSS, with component support from shadcn/UI, Radix UI, and Lucide Icons.
*   **Backend & Storage**: Supabase for database, authentication, and storage needs.
*   **Machine Learning Integration**: scikit-learn or TensorFlow alongside OpenAI GPT-4o.
*   **Development & Deployment**: Docker for environment consistency, with GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
*   **IDEs**: Visual Studio Code, Replit, and Expo for diverse development and testing environments.
*   **AI Tools**: Bolt for project scaffolding, Claude AI and Cursor AI for coding assistance, and ChatGPT for advanced code generation.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   Ensure responsive design for usability across desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
*   Secure user authentication and data encryption utilizing Supabase's tools.
*   Minimal load times for an optimal user experience.
*   Compliance with privacy standards, including handling anonymized data where viable.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   Requires availability and stability of the GPT-4o model for AI operations.
*   Assumes strong network connectivity for seamless integration with GitHub.
*   Assumes that the targeted regions are North America and Europe with developers comfortable with English.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   GitHub API rate limits might restrict high-frequency sync operations.
*   Dependency management across various AI and ML libraries could pose challenges.
*   Ensuring data privacy in AI-powered functionalities may require implementing additional security measures.

Suggestions to mitigate these potential issues include setting up cache strategies with tools like Redis to manage API limits efficiently and running regular audits on AI processes and data handling to better align with privacy best practices.
